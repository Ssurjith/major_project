Statement-based questions: Analyze a statement and ask related questions (e.g., reasons behind it, its implications).
Number of statements correct: Assess understanding by asking how many statements from a set are true (often with a mix of true/false statements).
Direct questions: These test knowledge application and higher-order thinking skills. They might ask for analysis, evaluation, suggesting solutions, or comparing viewpoints on a topic.
Case studies: Analyze a real-world scenario and ask questions about its causes, effects, or potential solutions (often in Essay papers).
Difficulty Level:

Graded Difficulty: Papers typically have a mix of easy, moderate, and difficult questions to assess a wide range of knowledge levels.
Focus on Critical Thinking: The aim is to go beyond simple recall of facts. Questions often require candidates to analyze data, interpret information, form well-reasoned arguments, and demonstrate critical thinking skills.
Ethical Dilemmas: Some questions might present ethical dilemmas related to governance, policy, or social issues. Candidates are expected to analyze the situation and suggest well-considered responses.

UPSC Trends: Stay updated on current affairs and emerging issues relevant to the UPSC syllabus. Questions often reflect these trends.
Language and Presentation: Questions are presented in grammatically correct and formal English.

3. Detailed Responses: For each question, provide a correct answer and a detailed explanation of why that answer is
correct. Include categorization details such as the relevant sectors, topics, and main keywords.

4. Format Requirements: Return the questions in a JSON array, each represented as an object containing the following
fields:
    - questionnumber: Starting from 1 for the first question.
    - questions: The text of the question.
    - correctanswer: The index character of the correct option ('a', 'b', 'c','d').
    - explanation: Explanation for why the answer is correct.
    - categories: A string listing relevant sectors, topics, and keywords.
    - options: An object with keys 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd' representing possible answers.

5. Adherence to Request: Generate exactly the number of questions requestedâ€”no more, no less. Ensure that all 
generated questions maintain the strict format of multiple-choice as demonstrated in the context. Also be sure that u 
don't miss the statements in multiple statementwise questions .
